				Document Object Vs Window object

	In web development java script has a important role in creating web pages which is 
dynamic and interactive. Window object and Document object are the two main objects that every
 web developer frequently uses. Even these two objects are similar, they give different purpose 
and have distinct roles inside the browser environment. And these objects are the essential
 components of the Document Object Model (DOM) in web. So we will explore and compare these 
two objects with their properties, methods, and their intractability in context of a web page.

*WINDOW OBJECT:
---------------
	It is a global object in the client - side JS, it representsthe browser window which 
has a DOM document and acts as the root of the Document obj model. 
Window object is well supported by all browsers, it represent the browsers window and will 
automatically includes global objects, functions and variables as its members.
 Window object is responsible in managing global variables, functions, and objects,and providing
 methods for browser interaction and also manages properties related to frames, tabs, windows.
 
  KEY PROPERTIES & METHODS OF WINDOW OBJECTS:

     1.Global Scope: 
	In a browser, global variables and functions declared with var are properties of the
	 window object:
  
	- var global_Var = "Hello World";
	- console.log(window.global_Var); // Output: "Hello World".

     2.Window Dimensions:
	- window.innerWidth :returns interiorwidth of windows content area
	- window.innerHeight:returns height of windows content area

     3.Window management:
	Used for managing the browser window.
          -window.open()
	  -window.close()
	  -window.moveTo()
	  -window.resizeTo()

     4.Timers
	Methods used to execute code after a delay or at regular intervals
	  -windows.setTimeout()
	  -window.setInterval()



*DOCUMENT OBJECT:
-----------------
	The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
 It provides access to the DOM ( Document Object Model), which is used in creating 
a Dynamic web pages. Document objects allows as to manioulate the content, structure
 and style of the web page which makes the web page more interactive.
Then browser generates a Document object model of web page upon loading it.

The DOM is a platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and updating
 of a web pages content, structure and style.

DOM converts the HTML page into a logical tree in which every element of the html page
 is turned into a node that links to other attirbutes or value or link and makes document 
object a the root node. These Node tree allows dynamic updates and interactions with
 web page content.


 KEY PROPERTIES & METHODS OF WINDOW OBJECTS:

      1.Accessing Elements
	 these are used to access elemnts in DOM: 
	   -documents.getElementbyId()
	   -document.getElementsByClassname()
	   -document.querySelector()
	   -document.querySelectorAll()

      2.Creating Elements:
	   - document.createElement() - it is used to create new elemnts dynamically.

   

*KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WINDOW AND DOCUMENT OBJECTS:
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The window obj is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy. it represents 
the entire browser window. document object is a property of the window object. It represents the
 content of the web page loaded in the browser window.

2. Window obj provides methods & properties for manipulating the browser window and execution 
global tasks like handling timers, window size and responding to browser events. whereas Document
 object provide metjods and properties to interact with the content of the web page. Document 
obj allows us to access and manipulate HTML elemnts, document information and many.

3. Window obj can influence the appearance and behaviour of the browser window, it doesn't interact
 with the content of HTML doctument directly.
but document obj directly linked to the HTML document and the DOM. so we can dynamically manipulate
 the documents structure,c content and style.


*CONCLUSION:
------------
 Both window and document objects are integral to web development using Java script, with different 
purpose. The window obj represents the browser window and provides methods and properties for
 controlling it.
Document obj represengs the HTML document and enables interaction with its content. using the both
 object in a efficient way we can build more user-friendly and interactive web pages.
